##Local Development
 - **Fork** the repository into your own account
 - Download VSCode and pull the repo locally
 - Download "Live Server" extension in VSCode.
  - When on the index.html file, hit the "Go Live" button at the bottom right.
  - This will allow you to quickly see changes locally on the web browser that is opened.

 - Hosting in Github Pages
  - On the repo, go to "Settings" -> "Pages"
  - Follow on screen instructions to host the **branch** that you want to show, and once complete, it will give you a link at the top of the page to go to to see changes.
   - Note: This may take >10 minutes to reflect changes, so its not good for testing. But it is good for playing!
